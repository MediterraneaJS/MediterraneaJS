      <h2>Don't be a jerk.</h2>
      <p>MediterráneaJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not
        tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
        without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

      <p>Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
        deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
        are expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>Exhibitors, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not
        use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
      <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
        else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by 'STAFF' t-shirts</p>
      <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="mailto:info@mediterraneajs.eu">info@mediterraneajs.eu</a>
        <br /> More contact options will follow soon.
      </p>

      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>

      <p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Conference_anti-harassment_policy">example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>
      <p>The MediterráneaJS organisers team thanks you in advance for valuing these rules.</p>

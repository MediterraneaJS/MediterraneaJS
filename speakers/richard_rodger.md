# Measuring Micro-services
The micro-service architecture has changed the game for software development. It provides the first scalable, effective component model for software systems. By embracing the organic, dynamic and chaotic nature of micro-services, you can built fault-tolerant, scalable and reactive systems.
But there is a dark side. Things can get out of control very quickly. As the number of micro- services, and messages and interactions between them grow, how do you keep control? How do you retain understanding of the system? How can you offer any commitments about its behavior to your CEO?
The answer is to embrace the complexity of the system, and recognize that it has emergent properties. Rather than auditing and tracking technical telemetry such as CPU usage, measure the behavior you care about, the business outcomes. This allows you to understand the effects of new deployments and failures at the right level.
This talk will cover the scientific measurement techniques that we have found to be most effective in the wild. The most useful metrics, and the best ways of capturing them is something we've discovered the hard way over the last three years. Embrace and build micro- services without fear of creating a monster!

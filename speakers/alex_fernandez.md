# The Fluid Architecture

Deciding on an architecture has to be a very big deal. Two, three or more layers? What database to use: SQL, NoSQL or NewSQL? In many companies there are entire departments dedicated to deciding on an architecture and then refining it until it's perfect. But the fact remains that there is not a perfect architecture for all situations, and probably not even for a particular situation. The modern stack has very stringent requirements of functionality, scalability, and cost, which keep changing all the time. So why do we expect a rigid architecture to thrive in such a changing environment?

We will illustrate the principles of the fluid architecture with real-life examples using Node.js and JavaScript.

## Why do you think people should love this talk?
I think there is a middle ground between monolithic architectural practices and random development. Many JavaScript devs are now building challenging applications and seeking a path that keeps them away from chaos; this talk is an attempt to show how to find that path.

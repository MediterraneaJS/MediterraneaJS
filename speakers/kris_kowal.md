# General Theory of Reactivity
In 1905, Einstein created a theory of special relativity that unified the concepts of space and time, and went on to incorporate gravity, to bring the three fundamentals of physical law into a single model. In JavaScript, we are arriving at a similar, unified model where values in both space and time have related interfaces. A General Theory of Reactivity unifies the temporal concepts of promises, observables, behaviors, and streams and relates them to their spatial counterparts of values, collections, iterators, and generators.

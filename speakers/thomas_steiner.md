# Disaster Detection and Monitoring with Wikipedia and JavaScript
In this talk, I will describe a global and language-independent
detection and monitoring system for disasters based on exactly 287
Wikipedia realtime edit streams. I use Node.js on the server and
vanilla JavaScript on the client, including a little-known browser API
called Server-Sent Events. The source code of the application is
shared under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, so that others can
build upon it and extend it. Be safe!

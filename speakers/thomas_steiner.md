# Dr. Thomas Steiner
I currently work from Hamburg, Germany as an Ads Solutions Engineer for Google.

Before that, I worked as a full-time researcher on the EU FP7 I-SEARCH project where I represented Google. My main research interests are the Semantic Web, Multimedia Semantics, and Social Networks.

In parallel to my job at Google, I worked on a PhD in Computing at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain. My thesis is on event summarization based on multimedia data from social networks and was successfully defended in May 2014.

Also in parallel to my job at Google, I have started a Postdoc at the Laboratoire d'InfoRmatique en Image et Systèmes d'information (LIRIS), Lyon, France where I work on models and tools for publishing and analyzing annotated videos of live performances.


# Disaster Detection and Monitoring with Wikipedia and JavaScript
In this talk, we will describe a global and language-independent detection and monitoring framework for disasters based on exactly 287 Wikipedia realtime edit streams. We use Node.js on the server and vanilla JavaScript on the client, including a little-known client-side API called Server-Sent Events. Be safe!

## Why do you think people should love this talk?
It's about JavaScript for good (disaster detection and monitoring), it's about realtime streams, and it has a nice demo.

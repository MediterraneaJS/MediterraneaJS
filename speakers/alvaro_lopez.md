# OpenStack
OpenStack is a technology that is dramatially changing how cloud computing is deployed and operated. Given the adoption that it's having and the growth of its community, it is in a way "the new Linux" in many ways, and thus the attention it has been receiving lately.

This talk will introduce OpenStack for both a pragmatic and technical points of view. It will discuss what the technology is, how the community works, and will briefly cover how it can be easily deployed in proof of concept environments.

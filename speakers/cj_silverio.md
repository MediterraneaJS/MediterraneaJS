# Cheating Gall’s Law
Or, how we split a monolith and lived to tell the tale. This is the story of how npm replaced its monolithic registry service with microservices. We rolled out the registry without any users noticing this huge change behind the scenes. Gall’s Law says that every complex working system must have evolved from a simple working system. So how do you get away with a rewrite like this? I’ll tell you how.

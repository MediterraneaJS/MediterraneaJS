# Code is a job
Writing great code is a challenge. We have to use the best frameworks, spend every hour of every day at the keyboard.. The key to writing great code, we're told, is passion. But what if, in order to write great code, we need to do exactly the opposite? Code is a job, after all. What if the simplest way to improve our code is to treat it like one?

# Omega Projects

Do you have an idea that will change the world?


Does it seem like it would make great science fiction?
Except that you are a programmer, and so you could just build it?
Is it a vague idea that is hard to explain?


Congratulations, you are one of the many people who have an Omega Project!
It may seem incredibly strange, but Omega Projects are very common
amongst programmers.  
This talk is my observations on the experience of attempting to build
my omega project,
and also my observations on famous Omega Projects attempted from history.

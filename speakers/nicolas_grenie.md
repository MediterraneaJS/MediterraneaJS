# Nicolas Grenié
I am a 22 year old French computer engineering student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Technology of Belfort Montbéliard (France, www.utbm.fr).

I just spent a year interning at ifeelgoods in the Bay Area. During this year I enjoyed being part of a dynamic team working on a disruptive product. This experience showed me the real life of being in a startup. It was also a great opportunity to work with a lot of different APIs and attending events (TechCrunch Disrupt, F8 hackathon, SXSW,...)

# Building Hypermedia APIs in JavaScript
There is currently a major shift sweeping over the software industry.

With each passing day the world is becoming more and more API-driven. When building an API there are many design options and Hypermedia is the new emerging way of designing APIs. Hypermedia APIs are widely used by companies such as Paypal and Amazon.

In this session I will discuss the principles of Hypermedia APIs and the different ways to implement one in Node.js. I will first introduce you to a basic implementation using Express and then move on to a more advanced solution using a dedicated framework: Fortune.js.

I will also share my experience of building APIbunny (http://apibunny.com), an API-driven easter game.

Why do you think people should love this talk?
Hypermedia is a new topic, on the "hype" with a lot of curiosity.

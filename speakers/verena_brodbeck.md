# Verena Brodbeck
Former physician and neuroscientist, discovered late in life that web programming is the hidden professional dream designation.
After a career switch 2 years ago, now happily employed frontend developer and JS apprentice. Also music lover and wanna be chef - in a next life.

# Love at first language
Why JS was a great choice as a first language for a late beginner in programming. Experienced multi-lingual programmers seem to have a hard time with some of JS' concepts. For a beginner, new to any programming, it might be that exactly this allows for a special love story with JS. I'll talk about my late entrance into the world of programming, a love story by itself, and by way of a concrete JS language feature I'll show how the beginnerâ€™s point of view can be different, and maybe even an advantage to learning the concepts of JS.

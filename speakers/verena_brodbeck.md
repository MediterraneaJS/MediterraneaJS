Former physician and neuroscientist, discovered late in life that web programming is the hidden professional dream designation.
After carreer switch 2 years ago, now happily employed frontend developer and JS apprentice. Also music lover and wanna be chef - in a next life.

# Love at first language
Experienced multilingual programmers seem to have a hard time with some of JS's concepts. For a beginner, new to any programming, it might be that exactely that allows for a special love story with JS.
Using scope* as an example my talk will be about a late entrance to the world of programming, a love story by itself, and how the beginnerâ€™s ankle is different if not an adavantage to learn basic concepts of JS.

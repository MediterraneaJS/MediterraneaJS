    <p>
      <br> In this full-day workshop, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, will present practical techniques, clever tricks and useful strategies you need to be aware of when working on any responsive design project. Most techniques are
      borrowed from mid-size and large-scale real-life projects, such as large e-commerce projects, online magazines and Web applications.</p>

    <p>We'll be looking at specific techniques for building well organised, front-end software, and wherever possible this work will be hands-on. Vitaly will introduce theories and ideas for dealing with common problems, and attendees will be assigned small
      tasks so they can experiment for themselves with these techniques. This will be involve a mixture of both individual and group work. There will be plenty of time allocated to discussions, so we can make sure that everyone understands how they can
      apply what they've learned to their specific working environments.</p>

    <p>In this workshop, you'll learn:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Effective
        <strong>tools and techniques</strong> that can support and enhance your personal workflow when working on any responsive design project,</li>
      <li>An overview of clever practical techniques for improving UX as well as performance of responsive sites,</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-end strategies</strong> for scalable, resolution-independent graphics and maintainable CSS code,</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responsive Design Patterns</strong> and innovative approaches to designing "responsive modules" such as tables, calendars, multi-level menus, maps and Web forms,</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing, debugging and maintenance techniques</strong> for responsive sites as well as lessons learned from Smashing Magazine's own redesign and
        <strong>performance optimizations</strong>,</li>
      <li>How to manage legacy browsers and deal with
        <strong>Internet Explorer 8 and Android 2.3</strong> in responsive projects,</li>
      <li>Technical issues (and solutions) for responsive advertising and
        <strong>responsive email newsletters</strong>,</li>
      <li>How the design processes should adapt in terms of the project management,
        <strong>deliverables</strong>, performance budgets, team organisation and strategy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This workshop is intended for professional designers, developers and everybody else who is dealing with responsive design regularly or wants to better understand responsive design in general. You should at least be familiar with some basics of responsive
      design, HTML5 and CSS.</p>

    <h3>What hardware/software do you need?</h3>

    <p>To get the most out of the workshop, you'll need to bring a laptop with your preferred text editor.</p>

    <p>
      <br> In this talk, we will describe a global and language-independent detection and monitoring framework for disasters based on exactly 287 Wikipedia realtime edit streams. We use Node.js on the server and vanilla JavaScript on the client, including a little-known client-side API called Server-Sent Events. Be safe!</p>

    <p>This workshop is intended for professional designers, developers and everybody else who is dealing with responsive design regularly or wants to better understand responsive design in general. You should at least be familiar with some basics of responsive

    <h3>People should love this talk because...</h3>

    <p>It's about JavaScript for good (disaster detection and monitoring), it's about realtime streams, and it has a nice demo.</p>

      <br> Deciding on an architecture has to be a very big deal. Two, three or more layers? What database to use: SQL, NoSQL or NewSQL? 
      In many companies there are entire departments dedicated to deciding on an architecture and then refining it until it's perfect. 
      But the fact remains that there is not a perfect architecture for all situations, and probably not even for a particular situation. 
      The modern stack has very stringent requirements of functionality, scalability, and cost, which keep changing all the time. 
      So why do we expect a rigid architecture to thrive in such a changing environment?
    
    </p>

    <p>We will illustrate the principles of the fluid architecture with real-life examples using Node.js and JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>People should love this talk because...</h3>
    <p>I think there is a middle ground between monolithic architectural practices and random development. Many JavaScript devs are now building 
       challenging applications and seeking a path that keeps them away from chaos; this talk is an attempt to show how to find that path.</p>

      <br> Most games are done in C++ or other "native" languages, but there are times when being able to develop faster is valuable 
      (prototypes, game jams, solo indie development, etc.). In this talk we will cover basic techniques of game development and how 
      we can use them with the aid of Phaser, a JS game framework.

    <h3>People should love this talk because...</h3>
    <p>People who are creative and love to do interactive stuff. Game developers who are new to JavaScript. JavaScript developers who want to start creating games.</p>

      <br> Avoid stepping into the rabbit hole with common anti-patterns and bad code. With a strong emphasis on how JavaScript code can be done beautiful and maintainable, this talk explains how to write very readable and testable code. At eBay we love to have our code clean, so we’ll use some examples of eBay’s code during this presentation.    
    </p>
    <p>  We’ll touch topics on how functional can intersect with object oriented programming to decrease the learning curve to your code. Or how choosing the correct data structures is more important than ever to guarantee optimal performance.    </p>
    <p>  All of this in a framework agnostic way, so that it is easy to take home and apply to your projects with ease.    </p>
    <p>  Hopefully after you have attended this talk you will code cleaner.    </p>

      <br> Concurrency is an important topic for any data-processing applications (multimedia, graphics, calculations etc.). However, in JavaScript it’s never been easy to make the code work in parallel – initially you had no options for that, and after years of demand all that you got was pretty basic Web Worker API which makes you to split the code into complicated client-server system which can communicate only via self-made messages. This affected both architecture complexity and readability of your code, making it extremely hard to parallelize already written code. But now, new ECMAScript APIs are coming and they are going to change literally everything – so let’s see how we can use them to breathe parallelism into our apps.
    </p>
  
    <h3>People should love this talk because...</h3>
    <p> A lot of people work with data-heavy applications, and they usually want to improve responsiveness for end-users. But, for most apps, it's not that easy to make already existing code work with Web Workers, especially when parallelized code needs to access DOM or to be controlled by user actions.</p>

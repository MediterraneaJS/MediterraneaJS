<p>There are three qualities that describe me best - I learn faster than others, I love to create and I&#39;m so eager for more, that I forget to enjoy the present.</p>
<p>To be brief, Iâ€™m a talented person with fresh ideas and strong experience in various technologies regarding web development, especially front-end.</p>
<h1 id="the-3rd-dimension-of-the-web-webgl-and-webvr">The 3rd dimension of the web - WebGL and WebVR</h1>
<p>WebGL is more and more broadly available on the devices in the wild. So how can we bring the third dimension to the web? Especially with new interactions made possible by Oculus Rift, Gear VR or Google Cardboard and input devices like LEAP Motion and Myo we&#39;ve got an enormous untapped potential for creating amazing things on the web.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s do this!</p>
<h2 id="why-do-you-think-people-should-love-this-talk-">Why do you think people should love this talk?</h2>
<p>A lot of people have seen or heard about WebGL, but not fully realised its potential - not only games, but a range of visualisations can be made real to improve the customer or user experience on your website. Plus: With experimental web technology we&#39;re about to unlock Virtual Reality and completely new ways of interacting with content on the web.</p>

<p>Why JS was a great choice as a first language for a late beginner in programming. Experienced multi-lingual programmers seem to have a hard time with some of JS&#39; concepts. For a beginner, new to any programming, it might be that exactly this allows for a special love story with JS. I&#39;ll talk about my late entrance into the world of programming, a love story by itself, and by way of a concrete JS language feature I&#39;ll show how the beginnerâ€™s point of view can be different, and maybe even an advantage to learning the concepts of JS.</p>

<p>Hi!, I’m David, I work at &amp;yet(<a href="http://andyet.com/">http://andyet.com/</a>), which makes me a yeti by definition (Q.E.D). I spend my days working with incredible people whom I follow and which I’m lucky to be able to call friends.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been curating <a href="http://lxjs.org">LXJS, the Lisbon Javascript Conference</a>, with the help of some extraordinary humans, empowering, encouraging and building the community that I want to be a part of, a topic, or more like a search, that I&#39;m very found of.</p>
<p>Other passions involve Information Security and P2P networks, in fact, I&#39;m currently very close to finish an engineering MSc with a major in P2P networks, having creating things like <a href="https://github.com/diasdavid/webrtc-explorer"><code>webrtc-explorer</code></a>, a browser DHT using WebRTC as a layer of transport (I love to talk about this stuff and learn more too, feel free to ping me anytime :)).</p>

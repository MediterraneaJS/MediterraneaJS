<h1 id="the-fluid-architecture">The Fluid Architecture</h1>
<p>Deciding on an architecture has to be a very big deal. Two, three or more layers? What database to use: SQL, NoSQL or NewSQL? In many companies there are entire departments dedicated to deciding on an architecture and then refining it until it&#39;s perfect. But the fact remains that there is not a perfect architecture for all situations, and probably not even for a particular situation. The modern stack has very stringent requirements of functionality, scalability, and cost, which keep changing all the time. So why do we expect a rigid architecture to thrive in such a changing environment?</p>
<p>We will illustrate the principles of the fluid architecture with real-life examples using Node.js and JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-you-think-people-should-love-this-talk-">Why do you think people should love this talk?</h2>
<p>I think there is a middle ground between monolithic architectural practices and random development. Many JavaScript devs are now building challenging applications and seeking a path that keeps them away from chaos; this talk is an attempt to show how to find that path.</p>
